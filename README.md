Hi MappedIn, here's my submission for the little challenge I was given. Replicating the [Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/L7wrq2mq/) given to display a user's starred Github repositories, in React.

# How to Run

Make sure you have [npm installed](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm), then navigate to the mappedin-challenge folder and run `npm-start`.  The app should now be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
